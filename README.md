#### In this study, we collected HR data from 14,999 employees on Kaggle and applied various machine learning algorithms, including Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Support Vector Machines, Random Forests, and Artificial Neural Networks. Our objective was to identify the key factors influencing turnover.

#### To gauge model performance from a company's perspective, we introduced a novel metric named "Total Gain," calculated as the difference between assigned "Profit" and "Loss." The additional metrics, including PPV, FNR, TPR, etc., provide a more nuanced understanding of the model's performance.

#### Our results revealed that the Random Forest model consistently outperformed other models, highlighting "employee satisfaction" as the most influential variable affecting turnover.
